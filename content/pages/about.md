Welcome to this my website. Second best blogger on the planet besides Creed Bratton. Its some combination of a blog and a collection of some random personal projects I've done in the past year. After college I plan to move to Seattle and hopefully start a career in IT before eventually applying for an MBA and climb the corporate ladder even further. (Please don't end up in a cubicle. Currently I'm an Account Manager at OMT Enterprises facilitating the Amazon Vendor Central/Seller Central Sector emphasizing on order fullfillment, advertising analytics, shipment logistics, and research and development.

This site is mainly just to document my life and keep as an online journal. About the same price of owning a journal (10 bucks for custom domain name) with endless possibilities.
