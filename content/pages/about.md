Welcome to my website. I'm the second best blogger on the planet besides Creed Bratton. This website is some combination of a blog and a collection of some random personal projects I've done in the past year. After college I plan to move to Seattle and hopefully start a career in IT before eventually applying for an MBA and climb the corporate ladder even further. (Please don't end up in a cubicle). Currently I'm an Account Manager at OMT Enterprises facilitating the Amazon Vendor Central/Seller Central Sector emphasizing on order fullfillment, advertising analytics, shipment logistics, and research and development.

  Hobbies: Poker, Basketball, Stock Options (r/WallStreetBets)
  
  Favorite Artists: Dominic Fike, Kanye West, Coast Modern, & The Strokes
 
  Favorite Colors: Green or White
  
  Favorite Athlete: Kobe Bryant
  
  Favorite Movie: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
  
  Favorite Shows: Regular Show or ATLA
 
This site is mainly just to document my life and keep as an online journal. About the same price of owning a journal (10 bucks for custom domain name) with endless possibilities.
