I'm talking about r/HardwareSwap on Reddit. Thankfully due to free markets, this subreddit has been emerging as my personal favorite spot to buy all things electronics. With 100,000 active users there are tens of thousands of items being listed every day for below MSRP, non-taxed, and hard to seek items. Just search the item you are looking for on https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwareswap/ and compare with eBay. You'll usually find out that HardwareSwap has the best prices and every now and then you can be the first to stumble upon a great deal.

Before browsing the subreddit you'll first have to make an account and meet the guidelines for commenting in order to buy. This is around 50 comment karma and 50 post karma which takes around a day to accumulate. You can use subreddits dedicated towards karma "farming" such as https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeKarma4U/ to do so. After doing this you'll now have permission to comment on people's sale posts and hopefully buy some steals.

The phrase "the early bird gets the worm" holds true to r/HardwareSwap and most of the "steals" you'll find usually go within minutes to lurkers who refresh the new tab every 3 minutes. This is usually for items offered at a significant discount which hovers around 30-40% less that eBay comp pricing. Other items include high-demand items such as the new 30-xx GPU's or PS5s that are sold for MSRP which tend to go almost instantly. Besides that, feel free to use the search bar to find whatever your heart desires. 

The most savings you'll find from buying off of r/HardwareSwap comes from the taxes that you'll save instead of buying from a retailer. With items often going for less that MSRP on r/HardwareSwap and savings in taxes, I've come to the conclusion that the free market tax-excluded market that r/HardwareSwap offers reigns king if you're willing to accept the relatively small risk. After all if you do get scammed charging back with PayPal should be easy as buyer protection tends to be stellar with the company.
