I'm talking about r/HardwareSwap on Reddit. Thankfully due to free markets, this subreddit has been emerging as my personal favorite spot to buy all things electronics. With 100,000 active users there are tens of thousands of items being listed every day for below MSRP, non-taxed, and hard to seek items. Just search the item you are looking for on https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwareswap/ and compare with eBay. You'll usually find out that HardwareSwap has the best prices and every now and then you can be the first to stumble upon a great deal.

Of course with great rewards comes great risks. Stay tuned to see how you can minimize risk while shopping on subreddits such as HardwareSwap.
