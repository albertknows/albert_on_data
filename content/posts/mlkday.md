Hello Twitter World,

It's OJ. Lmao just kidding. I gotta get outta here. I just read this great quote online that I'm trying to uphold in my life. "If you can't fly, then run, if you can't run then walk, if you can't walk then crawl, but by all means keep moving." It's said that Dr. Martin Luther King wrote this quote but I do see some contradictions saying that MalcomX or some famous monk saying the quote before hand but you get the gist. I'm trying to keep moving I can promise you that and I hope that one day I look upon this moment in my life and smile. I hope that 2021 is my year.

Albert
