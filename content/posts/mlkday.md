Hello Twitter World,

It's AF.  I just read this great quote online that I'm trying to uphold in my life. "If you can't fly, then run, if you can't run then walk, if you can't walk then crawl, but by all means keep moving." It's said that Dr. Martin Luther King wrote this quote but I do see some contradictions saying that MalcomX or some famous monk saying the quote before hand but you get the gist. 2020 was a crazy year. I took so many people for granted such as my Grandpa, Kobe Bryant, Chadwick Boseman, and Jerry Springer. I'm trying to keep moving, I can promise you that and I try my best to never look back. I hope that 2021 is my year and I hope it's yours too.
