\*\* Paid Newsletter


**Note**: This was collected by hand because my web scraping gameplan didn't account for newsletters that go to multiple different links... Could I have built some super cool algorithm to collect this? ...Maybe? But I didn't. Instead, I just collected links for about an hour or two and here we are.  Although the process was rather tedious, it probably provides a lot of value to you guys, so I'd say it was worth it.

#### honorable mention

These newsletters were mentioned one time each in the lists I was referencing. FYI to the two people who are combing through the source links wondering why **newsletter x** or **newsletter y** wasn't included - I took out newsletters where the links were no longer functional.
