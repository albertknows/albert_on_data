Last week we a colossal rally for the stock PLTR headed by PayPal founder Peter Thiel. Increasing over 134.9% in the last month, PLTR saw an extremely increase in popularity on r/wallstreetbets due to users banking on the importance that big data plays in the society we live in. With contracts with the government, FBI, CIA, and COVID-19 vaccine companies, PLTR seems like a no-brainer in a world where data holds a significant ammount of value. Last Friday I entered my position in PLTR with:

PLTR 12/31/20 $30 Call

x2 PLTR 01/08/20 $34 Call

PLTR 01/08/20 $30 Call

PLTR 01/15/21 $34 Call

PLTR 01/15/21 $34 Call

This was during PLTR's short dip from its peak last Friday to around 28.20 USD but as Monday rolled in SPY futures indiciated a red day. To top it off articles such as Citron's claims of PLTR being a "full-on casino" began to emerge, https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/palantir-stock-price-target-short-selling-position-citron-research-pltr-2020-11-1029845368, leading to a pullback to around $23.20 on Tuesday. Bloomberg Terminals also indicated a Morgan Stanley analyst had downgraded the stock from 17 USD to 15 USD PT before Tuesday opening, indicating a bloodbath.

So what did I learn:

1. Diamond Hands. Don't sell on the dip especially with exp. dates more than two weeks out. Hold and believe. 

2. This is why trading weeklys (Exp Date within 7 Days) are so dangerous and calls should be given time so that you don't get messed up due to theta.

3. Timing in the market > Timing the Market. This was one of my first trades where emotions overtook rationality and FOMO led to me buying calls. 

4. PLTR 45 EOY. Data is Gold in the 21st century. PLTR isn't going anywhere especially with Thiel and Karp backing the company.
