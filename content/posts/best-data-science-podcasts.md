Long Term: https://seekingalpha.com/article/4392952-palantir-valuation-opening-black-box. Last week we saw a colossal rally for the stock PLTR headed by PayPal founder Peter Thiel. Increasing over 134.9% in the last month, PLTR saw an increase in popularity on r/wallstreetbets due to users banking on the importance that big data plays in the society we live in. With contracts with the government, FBI, CIA, and COVID-19 vaccine companies, PLTR seems like a no-brainer in a world where data holds a significant amount of value.

Short Term: Articles such as Citron's claims of PLTR being a "full-on casino" began to emerge, https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/palantir-stock-price-target-short-selling-position-citron-research-pltr-2020-11-1029845368, leading to a pullback to around $23.20 on Tuesday. Bloomberg Terminals also indicated a Morgan Stanley analyst had downgraded the stock from 17 USD to 15 USD PT before Tuesday opening leading to a downward trend around $22.
