For the past few years I've been trying to find out the proper method to letting go. Not just people, but negative habits and traits in hopes of improving my personal life. I would scour every resource online such as Reddit threads, Youtube videos, books and blogs trying to find the answer to this question. Over 90% of the answers mentioned that letting go would require an out of sight and out of mind mentality where you would have to  replace these missing aspects of your life with new and healthy ones. I took this advice as trying to find distractions in order to move on from what was once familiar and essentially block old thoughts/actions with new ones. It sounded easy enough. 

I would begin to make a list of everything that I would do to keep busy in hopes of forgetting the past and moving on with life. I deleted most social media platforms on my phone as it made me unproductive for hours of my day. In replacement of this I began to make a blog where I would learn key website development skills and spend time just writing posts. I began to work out and run and eventually became enjoyable throughout my daily life… just putting on my headphones and going outside. I would dedicate myself to school by increasing my class load every quarter which would shorten my graduation time to 2 years and 2 quarters. Despite filling up my time spent during the day with these productive distractions,  I still struggled with letting go. 

Eventually I learned that "letting go" can be misconstrued and actually manifest as a form of aversion. You aren't really "letting go"; you're instead pushing things away by turning your attention to something else -- the "present" moment. The stuff is still there, it still bothers you, but you become more skilled at ignoring it -- but the reality is this mindset won't solve anything as it's just a distraction. "Letting go" is a form of acceptance and surrender. You accept and surrender to the moment completely. You don't push anything away nor run away to "the moment”. Instead, you let that thought or feeling come to mind, you allow the stress, you feel it completely, and you surrender to it. I learned that by letting the emotions flow, embracing the pain, and then accepting what you can’t control is when you truly get to move on.
