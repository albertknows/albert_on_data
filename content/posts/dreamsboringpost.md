For some unspecified reason my dreams have gotten way more intense and vivid these past few weeks. They are usually sweet and one time I had this amazing dream about this chocolate and vanilla cake with blue frosting that I swear I could literally taste and smell in the dream. I lifted the spoon full of cake and right as I was going to eat it… I woke up. SMH.

Other times they are horrible. I swear the bad dreams come way more often than the good ones. They are mostly about thoughts lingering in my mind or bad memories but I even had one where my teeth were literally falling out and I could feel the root of the tooth ripping from my gums. Wild. These bad dreams definitely make me appreciate those good dreams even more, but I really wish they would stop.

Just ranting now but through research aka Google I think the general consensus is that all that dream interpretation/analysis stuff is just pseudoscience. Maybe in this lifetime we’ll get to see some hard evidence backing this or some crazy technology being developed to further the pursuit of knowledge in this sector. I mean after all we humans do spend an average of 33% of our life on sleeping.

Well it’s time to go to sleep now. Night!
